**Key News in Spain This Week (Late December 2025 – Early January 2026)**

This week, spanning the end-of-year holidays and the start of 2026, was dominated by **weather events**, New Year celebrations, and forward-looking policy changes.

•  **Severe Weather and Flooding**: Torrential rains caused significant flash flooding in southern and eastern Spain, particularly Andalusia (including Málaga province). Reports indicate at least **three deaths**, with overflowing rivers sweeping away vehicles and prompting emergency responses in dozens of municipalities. Authorities urged residents to stay indoors as storms continued into the new year, with a new Atlantic storm (“Francis”) bringing rain, wind, and potential frost/snow in early January.

•  **New Year Celebrations and Transitions**: Spain welcomed 2026 with traditional festivities, including the eating of 12 grapes at midnight and family gatherings. The first babies of the year were born across the country, and attention turned to upcoming events like Three Kings’ Day (January 6). Political figures, including Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, reflected on 2025 achievements, while opposition leaders critiqued the government.

•  **Upcoming Changes Effective January 2026**:

	•  Drivers must now carry a **V-16 emergency beacon light** (replacing traditional warning triangles) for breakdowns or accidents.

	•  New rules for pensions, e-scooters (insurance likely delayed), bank transaction monitoring, and public holidays (14 national/regional days, including several long weekends).

	•  A new nationwide €60/month travel pass for unlimited commuter trains and buses launches.

	•  Economic forecasts remain positive, with growth projections and pension spending hitting records.

Overall, a quiet holiday week disrupted by weather, with focus shifting to 2026 reforms and potential cold snaps ahead. Sports, politics, and year-end reviews filled lighter coverage.
