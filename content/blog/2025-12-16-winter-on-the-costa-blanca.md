Winter in the northern Costa Blanca,  charming towns like Denia, Jávea (Xàbia), Altea, and Calpe, is remarkably mild and inviting compared to much of Europe. Enjoying a Mediterranean climate protected by surrounding mountains like Montgó, the region sees average daytime temperatures ranging from 15–18°C (59–64°F), often climbing to 20°C or more on sunny days, with nights cooling to around 7–10°C. Rainfall is occasional and light, mostly in autumn spillover or brief showers, while sunshine averages 5–6 hours daily—even in January—making it a popular escape for those seeking winter sun without extreme cold. Snow is virtually unheard of at sea level, though rare frosts can occur inland.

This season transforms the area into a peaceful haven for outdoor activities and natural beauty. Beaches are quieter for brisk coastal walks, hiking trails through parks like Montgó Natural Park offer stunning views, and cycling routes thrive in the comfortable weather. Late winter brings the magical spectacle of almond trees bursting into pink and white blossoms across valleys, especially in areas like the Jalon Valley nearby, creating postcard-perfect landscapes. Towns remain lively with local markets, festivals, and gastronomy focused on seasonal produce, while the lack of summer crowds allows for relaxed exploration of historic old towns and seafront promenades.

Why not try this special time of year for yourself.
