Hola and welcome to SunSeaSangria!

If you’re dreaming of sunny days, salty sea air and a cold glass of sangria on a terrace somewhere along the Costa Blanca… you’ve just landed in the right place.

My name is Joanne, and I’ve called this beautiful stretch of Spanish coastline home for more than 20 years. What started as a holiday escape with my family turned into a full-blown love affair with the Costa Blanca—and we’ve never looked back.

For over 14 of those years we rented out our two little apartments under the very same name you see today: SunSeaSangria. Hundreds of lovely guests walked through our doors, spent their holidays swimming in the Med, exploring hidden coves, sipping café con leche in the plazas and (of course) enjoying far too many jugs of sangria at sunset. Those apartments weren’t just a business—they were our introduction to this incredible lifestyle, and they gave us so many stories, friendships and memories.

Life here has never been dull. Over the years I’ve cleaned villas (and apartments… lots of apartments!), hand-poured scented candles inspired by orange blossom and sea breezes, and taught English online to students in Asia.

And now? Now it’s time for a new chapter.

SunSeaSangria is back—this time as a website and blog dedicated to everything I love about living on the Costa Blanca. Expect:

•  Honest insider guides to the towns, beaches and mountain villages we know like the back of our hands

•  The best places for sunrise coffees, lazy lunches and late-night tapas

•  Real life here (the glorious bits and the funny “only in Spain” moments)

•  Tips for visitors, expats and anyone thinking of making the move

•  A sprinkle of recipes (because sangria and paella taste better when you know the local secrets)

This isn’t a glossy tourist board brochure. It’s written by someone who’s lived the dream (and occasionally the chaos!) for two decades—someone who still pinches herself when the almond trees blossom pink every February.

So whether you’re planning your first trip, already own a little place in the sun, or you’re just here for the pretty photos and a bit of Mediterranean escapism… pull up a chair, pour yourself something cold and stick around.
